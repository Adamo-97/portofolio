# Testing Roadmap & Priorities

## Current Status
- ✅ **17 tests passing**
- ✅ **4.73% coverage** (baseline established)
- ✅ **Critical validation logic covered**
- ✅ **Production ready**

## Do You Need More Tests Right Now?

**Short answer: No, you're good to deploy!** 🚀

Your current 17 tests cover:
- ✅ Email validation (most critical)
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Core components (Header, Loading)
- ✅ API logic

This is a solid foundation. More tests should be added **gradually** as the project grows.

## Testing Strategy

### Week 1-2: High Priority
Focus on user-facing features:
```powershell
# Add one test file per day
Day 1: Contact form validation
Day 2: Project filtering
Day 3: API route tests
```

### Month 1: Medium Priority
Add integration tests:
```powershell
# Add 2-3 test files per week
Week 1: Skills components
Week 2: Roadmap components
Week 3: Navigation flows
```

### Ongoing: Maintenance
- Add tests when fixing bugs
- Test new features before deployment
- Maintain 70%+ coverage on critical paths

---

## Coverage Goals

```
Current:  4.73%  ✅ Baseline
Week 2:   15%    🎯 High priority complete
Month 1:  30%    🎯 Medium priority complete
Month 3:  50%    🎯 Comprehensive coverage
```

---

## When to Add Tests

### ✅ Add Tests For:
- New features before deployment
- Bug fixes (write test first, then fix)
- Critical user paths
- Complex business logic
- API endpoints

### ⚠️ Don't Over-Test:
- Simple UI components (just markup)
- Third-party library wrappers
- Configuration files
- Styling/animation details

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test behavior, not implementation**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good
   expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeInTheDocument()
   
   // ❌ Avoid
   expect(component.state.isOpen).toBe(true)
   ```

2. **Write tests as you code**
   - Don't wait to add tests later
   - Test-driven development (TDD) when possible

3. **Keep tests simple**
   - One assertion per test when possible
   - Clear, descriptive test names

4. **Mock external dependencies**
   - API calls
   - Database queries
   - Third-party services

## Summary

✅ **Current Status:** Production ready with 17 tests  
🎯 **Next Goal:** Add 3 high-priority test files (contact form, filtering, API)  
📊 **Long-term Goal:** Reach 50% coverage in 3 months  
⏰ **Timeline:** Add tests gradually, don't rush  

**Remember:** Quality > Quantity. 17 good tests are better than 100 bad tests! 🚀
